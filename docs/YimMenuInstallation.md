# Xenos Tutorial

### Steps to inject a .dll using Xenos

1) Download Xenos from [here](https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos/releases/download/2.3.2/Xenos_2.3.2.7z).

2) (optional) The downloaded file is a .7z file. This means you need to open it with a program that can open such a file. 7z, WinRAR, and probably other programs can open it. To download 7z, go [here](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html). To download WinRAR, go [here](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html).

3) Extract the `Xenos64.exe` file from the .7z archive. For example put it on your desktop.

4) Run the `Xenos64.exe` file by double clicking it with the left mouse button. A window that says something about "changes on your computer" can pop up. Just press `Yes` to allow very good dll injection.

5) You should see the following window pop up.<br />

6) Now you will need to drag in the previously downloaded .dll file called `YimMenu.dll` (or related). You do this by holding the left mouse button while hovering with the mouse cursor over the `YimMenu.dll` (or related) file. Then move the mouse cursor over the "Images" box. Picture:<br />

Now release the left mouse button. The "Images" box should now look like this:<br />

7) Now you will need to start gta like you always do. After gta 5 is fully launched and you loaded into Story Mode, you need to select the GTA5.exe process.

8) To select the GTA5.exe process, click on the processes dropdown.<br />
