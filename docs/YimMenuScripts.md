# YimMenu Script Installation (~~for dummies~~ smart people)

### Steps to install a Lua Script for YimMenu ðŸ˜ƒ

*for fast people: folder is located at `%appdata%/YimMenu/scripts/`*

1) Download a Lua Script for YimMenu. The final file should end with `.lua`. The downloaded file can also be a `.zip`, `.rar`, and so on. In that case, you will need to extract the lua files first.

2) After you have your script (or multiple scripts), you need to put them into your scripts folder.

3) To do this, open the file explorer.<br />

6) If you recive the following error, make sure you have used YimMenu before (launched gta and injected YimMenu. You can find a tutorial [here](https://github.com/pierrelasse/YimStuff/blob/master/docs/YimMenuInstallation.md)).<br />

8) Now you just have to start GTA V and inject YimMenu, or reload all lua scripts in `Settings->Lua Scripts` and press the `Reload All` button (or related).
