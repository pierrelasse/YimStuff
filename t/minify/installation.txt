Run
  ./t.sh installminifier
or
  t.bat installminifier
to automatically install the minifier.


To manually install the minifier,

navigate to https://github.com/mathiasbynens/luamin/blob/master/luamin.js
and download the file using the small download button near the "Raw" button.

do the same for this one: https://github.com/fstirlitz/luaparse/blob/master/luaparse.js

After you downloaded both files, put them into the same directory as this file.
Ensure that the files are called "luamin.js" and "luaparse.js"
