# Lua Coding Standards
By following these guidelines, you can help maintain code consistency and quality within the project.

## Naming Style
- Global Variable: `thisIsAVariable`
- Local Variable: `thisIsAVariable`
- Global Function: `thisIsAFunction`
- Local Function: `thisIsAFunction`
- Yimutils API Function: `this_is_a_function`

## Formatting Style

Basic things are handled by the editorconfig extension.

### Merging Strings
When concatenating strings using the `..` operator, avoid spaces before and after it to save space and maintain a clean code appearance:

```lua
local concatenatedString = "string1".."string2"
```

# Your own version
